## The Name and Numbers

### What is this number?

_1184_. Duh

### OK, but why?

1184 and 1210 form the second pair of amicable numbers. Amicable numbers are two numbers whose divisors sum to the other number

i.e.
Divisors of 1184 => 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 37 + 74 + 148 + 269 + 592 = 1210

Divisors of 1210 => 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 22 + 55 + 110 + 121 + 242 + 605 = 1184

In the medieval times, couples would wear talismans with amicable number pairs. They symbolize harmony and romance.

Plus they are really interesting.

### Sure I buy it. So why is the name messed up?

Don't worry, it's intentional... [reason](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/vlcsnap-2017-09-21-15h46m40s186-640x480.png)

### Deep cut, but whose name is this?

It's my name. [Caleb (Oh)](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1470016474/image_400x400.jpg).

## The Piggy

### I get the charm now. What's the pig?

Well, it's actually a gift I forgot to give you after Thanksgiving. I have one and now you have one.

I bought it because the man who sold it to me was a marketing genius. He pretended he was carving wood and upsold cheap product. I loved his work ethic, so I bought two.
